## **Explanation**
Completing incomplete curves in images using OpenCV and spline interpolation.

### Steps:

1. **Preprocess the image:** Load the image, convert it to grayscale and binary.
2. **Detect edges:** Apply Canny edge detection to find the edges of the curve.
3. **Find contours:** Extract the contours (curves) from the edge-detected image.
4. **Identify endpoints:** Determine the start and end points of the curve segments.
5. **Interpolate the curve:** Use spline interpolation to complete the curve between the endpoints.
