# **Explanation**

Explored the concept of symmetry in images using OpenCV. It covers three types of symmetry:

**Vertical Symmetry:**
- Loads an image and converts it to grayscale.
- Flips the grayscale image vertically.
- Draws a vertical line down the center of the original image to visualize symmetry.

**Horizontal Symmetry:**
- Loads an image and converts it to grayscale.
- Draws a horizontal line across the center of the original image to visualize symmetry.

**Diagonal Symmetry:**
- Loads an image and converts it to grayscale.
- Draws a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right of the original image to visualize symmetry.
